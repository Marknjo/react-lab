# :rocket: React Lab

## :balloon: Overview

This is a simple setup for exercising React muscles. This is not project specific. Just want to keep track of the code I learn.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project). Initially it was build with react create app. However, Vite has an edge over React for its speed and ease of use, including configuration and installing scripts.

The code base in this repo is built using React 18 and typescript. Previously, the code was written in vannila JavaScript. See v17-lab.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Runs preview of the built app [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173)
