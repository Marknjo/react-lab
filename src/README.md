# :rocket: Advanced Redux

This section has been all about advanced redux.

1. Handling asynchronous calls using redux despite it being schronous
2. Handling data loads - fat component vs fat redux vs fat action creaters
3. Technics to hide or show data
4. Handling multiple reducers
5. Understanding technics for handling side effects - preloading data through db fetching or posting data to database (FIREBASE)
6. Redux Thunk and the whole idel of how to abstract data from the component and hand that functionality to the reducers - thunk.

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

- Handling asynchronous tasks - fetching and posting data to the database.
- Using middlewares - using redux thunk to hand over async task to redux rather than components.
- How to keep leaner component by abstracting redux like data to reducers
- Code organization

## :bookmark_tabs: Footnotes

- This lecture was more hands on. I did most of the activity by mostly reimplimenting code we had earlier tackled. So, the whole lesson was like recap and to test my remembrance of the earlier topics. I truely enjoyed every part of it. Especially, implementaion of the notification that exist of a timer. I exercised here how to use the power of closures by passing a function that scoops the timer.
- The app on the visul outlook looks simple, but the code base is quite a workload to make it work.
