# :rocket: A Practical Custom Hook

Goal is to send and fetch data using a custom hook from Firebase

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

- Rainforced creation of a custom hook
- Fetched and saved data using Firebase - super interesting
- How to prevent infinite loop by using useCallback()
- Two approaches to implement using callback and the consumption level
- Reinforced use of **_.bind()_** - the partial application pattern.

## :bookmark_tabs: Footnotes

- Not challenging except that part where I was getting infinite loops. Had to be reminded about reference types.
